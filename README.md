# ROBOT FACTORY
## Overview
Robot factory was a school project from my first year at Epitech Technology
The goal was to code a program that translate an assembly file in hexa write on a .cor file.

## Using
First you need to initialize the binary file :
- Navigate to the source folder using cd
- use ``make`` in your source folder to get the binary.

Once the binary file named ``asm`` is created in the source folder, you have to give at the binary file a assembly file.

**Syntax :**
To launch the translation :
```bash
    ./asm file.s
```
